## How can I support the Solidarity Economy?

### Grantmakers goal

Grantmakers play a role in the transformation of the sector by following the lead of BIPOC creatives who are innovating models for self-determination and community wealth. This work is part of an emergent movement in the United States that is known globally as the Solidarity Economy.

### Problem statement

As the cultural sector actively seeks alternatives to business-as-usual to create economic and racial justice in the sector and beyond, the main barriers for many Solidarity Economy cultural entities include (1) a lack of understanding by grantmakers of systems-change and existing power imbalances, (2) ways to support cooperative governance in the sector, (3) the best tools of support for Solidarity Economy business structures, deliberate incubation, and start-up capital, and (4) ways to change whole systems by (5) transforming investments and endowments and (6) advocating for systems-change policies to create a fiscal and legal enabling environment for Solidarity Economy cultures to thrive.

### Results

Shifts in Grantmakers Mindset, Practices, Programs, Investment/Endowment, and Policy Advocacy to support interconnected, locally-rooted models of community ownership and democratic governance to flourish in the arts and culture sector and beyond. This repairs inequity in the sector and allows those who have been most harmed by our current systems to achieve cultural, economic, and political power.

### Action — Legal Q&A

The table below presents some of the practices and policies that arts and culture grantmakers have adopted to support Solidarity Economies. _Note: This list is a working document, developed in dialogue with our interviewees, and it reflects a small snapshot of the range of practices underway as of March 2021. These grantmaking practices are the **result** of each group’s ongoing learning and shared commitment to long-term organizational transformation in the service of racial and economic justice in the sector and beyond. Practices will look different for each organization based on their culture, context, process, and desires._
