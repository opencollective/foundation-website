## Phase One (fall 2021) 

**Our aim is to connect cultural innovators across silos** - _popular arts educators, cultural organizers and creators, arts academics, economists, and grantmakers_ -  **who do not know one another well, but are building the cultural economy we want**. We need to socialize, study, and dream together before we can take collective action.

## Phase Two (spring 2022) 

**The future emerges as we deepen relationships and align our ideas, desires, and goals, collectively.** For example, do we want to map the culture and solidarity economy ecosystem? Do we want to gather in person? Do we want to create curricula for specific groups _(i.e. creators, money managers, public grantmakers, private grantmakers, giving circles)_? Do we want to focus on supporting regional organizers to lead this? Do we want to create a collective calendar of learning opportunities? What content and formats for learning should we prioritize?

## Phase Three (fall 2022) 

**We will manifest the future together.**
