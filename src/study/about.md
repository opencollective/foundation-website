# <span id="greeting">Welcome</span>

Did you know that **cultural workers are co-creating <i id="concept" data-concepts='<%= JSON.stringify(concepts.concepts) %>'></i>** right now?</br> They are spreading power and wealth and rooting it in their community.

Let's study together. **We invite you to study-into-action with us on seven [Fridays this fall](#fridays)**, to participate in our solidarity [value flow](#value-flow), and to [connect with us](#contact).

Our aim is to **connect cultural innovators across silos** who do not know one another well, but are building the cultural economy we want. We need to socialize, study, and dream together before we can take collective action.

Thank you for your interest in **building relationships across culture and the [solidarity economy](https://art.coop/#concepts)**. Artists need the solidarity economy, and the solidarity economy needs artists!
