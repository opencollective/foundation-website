Solidarity is [our guiding principle](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/about/solidarity-our-guiding-principle) at Open Collective Foundation. We practice what we preach. Here are some ways that **transparency** (“Open”) and **shared work** (“Collective”) are embodied by us, the people you will meet at OCF:

1. We **set our salaries together** and account for responsibility level, as well as debt, disability, disadvantage, dependents, and more - B[log Post 1](https://blog.opencollective.com/team-set-salaries-ocf/) and [2](https://blog.opencollective.com/ocfs-journey-to-a-new-compensation-model).
2. We practice **[distributed leadership](https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/how-to-grow-distributed-leadership-7f6b25f0361c).**
3. We **set our own schedules**, to balance care for ourselves and our communities with our accountability and service to collectives.
4. We have a [**fund for learning** and coaching](https://opencollective.com/foundation/projects) to support individual growth.
5. We use a **stewardship model** where each person on the team supports one other person in their growth.
6. **See our [docs](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/about/mission-and-values) for more!**

We have a unique role to play as steward of a legal, financial, and technical commons—a piece of shared infrastructure—that is resonating deeply with the [Solidarity Economy movement](https://neweconomy.net/solidarity-economy/). We can build bridges between 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsorship, the open source community (where we have deep roots), mutual aid groups (100+ are hosted by OCF today), and the movement at large.
