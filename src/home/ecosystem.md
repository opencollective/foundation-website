## The Solidarity Economy Ecosystem

A number of organizations that support the Solidarity Economy in the United States have emerged in the past decade, and in recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number and diversity of entities providing support to Solidarity Economy organizations. However, although artists and culture-bearers participate in many of these as workers and beneficiaries, few of these entities place an emphasis on art and culture.

### Key Social and Solidarity Economy Organizations and Networks

#### International Solidarity Economy Networks and Task Forces

- [The UN Inter-Agency Task Force on Social and Solidarity Economy](https://unsse.org/) (TFSSE) aims to raise the visibility of Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE) within the UN system and beyond. The members and observers of the Task Force have committed to undertake collaborative activities to: enhance the recognition of the role of SSE enterprises and organizations in sustainable development; promote knowledge of SSE and consolidate SSE networks; and support the establishment of an enabling institutional and policy environment for SSE.
- [Global Social Economy Forum](https://www.gsef-net.org/) is an international association of local governments and civil society networks engaged in the promotion of the Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE) as a means to achieve an inclusive and sustainable local development. As of May 2020, GSEF brings together 75 members on the 5 continents coming from 36 countries, including 26 local governments and 35 SSE networks.
- [International Centre of Research and Information on the Public, Social and Cooperative Economy](http://www.ciriec.uliege.be/en/) (CIRIEC) is a network of companies, organizations, and experts interested in economic activity oriented towards collective support.
- [Research Network For Social Enterprise](https://emes.net/) (EMES) is a research network of established university research centers and individual researchers whose goal has been so far to gradually build up an international corpus of theoretical and empirical knowledge, pluralistic in disciplines and methodologies, around SE concepts: social enterprise, social entrepreneurship, social economy, solidarity economy, and social innovation.
- [Community Economies Research Network](https://www.communityeconomies.org/about/ce-research-network-cern) (CERN) is an international network of researchers, activists, artists, and others who are interested in ways of enacting new visions of the economy.
- [RIPESS North America](http://www.ripess.org/continental-networks/north-america/?lang=en) RIPESS is a global network of continental networks committed to the promotion of Social Solidarity Economy. The member networks themselves (Latin America and the Caribbean, North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania) bring together national and sectoral networks, thus ensuring strong territorial anchoring.
